## Lab 1: Density Estimation and Classification
Given 2 datasets I had to extract


## Lab 2: K-Means
Coding of the standard K-means algorithm using pre-defined centroids and then with just one 
given centroid and two-three randomly generated ones.


## Lab 3: Classification Using Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Coded a basic neural network then made an evalute function to test the accuracy of that
neural net.
